# Timed Walk App

Apache Cordova app that allows people to perform time walk tests, like the 6-minute walk test.
The algorithm that computes the distance from the GPS is the same as the one used in [this paper](https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/1/e13756/).

This app is not certified as a medical device and should be used only for general wellbeing or as a home-based complement to more rigorous clinical assessment.
