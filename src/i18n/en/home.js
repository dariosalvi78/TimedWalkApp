  title: 'Timed walk app',
  intro: `This app measures the distance you walk in a given amount of time.
  This is sometimes called "Timed walk test". The distance you walk in the
  chosen time can be used as an indication of your exercise capacity and
  general health status.`,
  durations: `The most commonly used timed walk is the 6-minute walk test, but other
  durations, like 3 minutes or 12 minutes have also been used. The app
  allows you to set the length of time you prefer for your test.`,
  app: `The app measures the distance using the positioning systems embedded
  in your phone, like the GPS. You therefore need to <b>perform the test
  outdoor</b> or it may be not possible to measure the distance.`,
  disclaimer: `Even though the algorithm that estimates the walked distance has been
  validated in clinical settings, this app is <b>not a medical device</b>.
  It should be used for general well-being or as a home-based complement
  to conventional clinical assessment.`
