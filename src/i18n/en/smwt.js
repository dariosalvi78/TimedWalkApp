  With this app, you can perform a six-minute walk test (6MWT).
  The purpose of the test is to measure functional exercise capacity especially
  in chronic respiratory disease and heart failure.
  The test has also been used in healthy older adults, people undergoing knee or
  hip arthroplasty, fibromyalgia, and scleroderma.
  If you are in general good health conditions, there is no reason to use this perform a 6MWT.

<p>
  The 6MWT was developed by Balke in 1963.
  It is currently recommended because of its reproducibility and ease of operation
  compared to other tests.
  Timed walks under 4 minutes are considered not as sensitive to evaluate the
  differences in walked distances as with 6 minutes.
  As the fitness conditions may vary depending on the day and time the test is
  performed, variations below 50 meters (or more, depending on the disease) are
  not considered significant.
