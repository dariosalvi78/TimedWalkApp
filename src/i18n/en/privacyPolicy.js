When you perform a test, this app retrieves the following information from
your phone:
<ul>
  <li>
    The geographical position of your phone. This is used to compute
    the distance you walk.
  </li>
  <li>
    The number of steps you walk (if provided by your phone).
    This is used to complement the information about the distance.
  </li>
</ul>
During the test, these data are temporarily stored on the phone. You can decide
to share these data at the end of the test, using the dedicated button.
This will allow you to select the mean (email, SMS or else) and the recipient and
is totally under your control. When starting the following test, these data will
be deleted.
<br>
A history of past tests is also kept. In this history only the date of the test,
the duration, the distance you have walked and the number of steps are recorded.
You can also decide to share this data, if you wish, using email, SMS or other
with whom you prefer.
<br>
To keep your data safe, it is recommendable to set a password, or any other
protection mean, on your phone, to prevent any unauthorised person to
access your data.
