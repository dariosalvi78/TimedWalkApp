        When you perform a test, this app retrieves the following information from
        your phone:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The geographical position of your phone. This is used to compute
          the distance you walk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Movement measured by your phone, like acceleration, orientation and steps.
          This is used to complement the information about the distance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During the test, these data are temporarily stored on the phone. You can decide
        to share these data at the end of the test, using the dedicated button.
        This will allow you to select the mean (email, SMS or else) and the recipient and
        is totally under your control. When starting a new test, these data will
        be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A history of past tests is also kept. In this history only the date of the test,
        the duration, the distance you have walked and the number of steps are recorded.
        You can also decide to share this history, if you wish, using email, SMS or other
        with whom you prefer by tapping on the share button.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep your data safe, it is recommendable to set a password, or any other
        protection mean, on your phone to prevent any unauthorised person to
        access your data.
      </p>
