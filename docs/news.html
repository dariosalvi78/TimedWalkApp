          <h3>2023-10-03: Timed Walk app being used in a research study about chronic pain–early cognitive decline in
            older adults</h3>

            In a rsearch protocol published at <a href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2023/1/e47319">JMIR Research
              Protocols</a> researchers have designed a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to establish the
            efficacy of the mind-body activity program named "Active Brains" in improving self-reported and objective
            outcomes of physical, cognitive, and emotional functions in 260 older adults.
            Researchers have decided to employ the Timed Walk app to measure the 6-minute walk distance as one of the
            primary outcomes.

            In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36131494/">new study</a>
            conducted at Linköping University,
            37 volunteers, including cardiac patients, performed a conventional
            6MWT with the guidance of a care professionals
            and a 6MWT at home, using the Timed Walk app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers compared the distance measured with the standard
            6MWT in clinic, and the one at home, using the app, and found that the mean of the
            differences was -4m ± 45m, with an overall agreement of 97% and an ICC of 0.96.
            These results are compatible with what was found in
            <a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/6/e22748">the study conducted at Oxford</a>
            where the difference between distances was 2m ± 47m.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors conclude that:
            <q>Use of an app is feasible, reliable and valid to assess 6MWD.</q>
