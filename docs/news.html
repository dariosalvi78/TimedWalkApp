            In a <a href="https://formative.jmir.org/2024/1/e46820/authors">paper published on JMIR Formative
              Research</a>, authors from Brisbane, Australia, have compared a conventional 6MWT with one performed with
            the app, on 36 patients with persistent pain.
            They show that while the two measurements have excellent correlation and ICC, the limits of agreement fall
            slightly outside the maximum allowable difference of 100m (LOAs= -77m and 104m).
            It has to be noted that the tests were performed on the same day, but at different times, in other words, it
            is not clear to what extent these differences are due to inaccuracy introduced by the app or to subjects'
            variations in the walked distance, as also discussed by the authors.
            The study provides some interesting exploratory analysis, for example showing that tests performed using
            Android phones had a higher difference, or that patients scored higher pain when performing the conventional
            6MWT rather than the app-based one.

            pulmonary hypertension patients performed a 6MWT in clinic and a series of tests at home: a Timed Up and Go
            (TUG) test, a Sit-to-Stand (STS), a Step Test (ST), and a tele-6MWT (T6MWT). The T6MWT was performed using
            the Timed Walk App.
            Results confirm excellent correlation between conventional 6MWT and app-based T6MWT (r=0.93) and agreement
            in direction of change of the 6MWD (79% of the cases).
            Interestingly, the T6MWT could only be performed by 49% of patients, compared to, for example, 97% of
            patients who completed the TUG test.

            In a research protocol published at <a href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2023/1/e47319">JMIR Research
              Protocols</a> researchers designed a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to establish the
            efficacy of the mind-body activity program named "Active Brains" in improving self-reported and objective
            outcomes of physical, cognitive, and emotional functions in 260 older adults.
            Researchers decided to employ the Timed Walk app to measure the 6-minute walk distance as one of the
            primary outcomes.
            The same research group previously published the study protocol for the <a
              href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2021/1/e25351"></a>"Virtual Active Brains-Fitbit (AB-F)"
            study</a>, a live video program for older adults with chronic pain and cognitive decline that teaches
            mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count.

            In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36131494/">new study</a>
            conducted at Linköping University,
            37 volunteers, including cardiac patients, performed a conventional
            6MWT with the guidance of a care professionals
            and a 6MWT at home, using the Timed Walk app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers compared the distance measured with the standard
            6MWT in clinic, and the one at home, using the app, and found that the mean of the
            differences was -4m ± 45m, with an overall agreement of 97% and an ICC of 0.96.
            These results are compatible with what was found in
            <a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/6/e22748">the study conducted at Oxford</a>
            where the difference between distances was 2m ± 47m.
